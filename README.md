# PartonShowerUncertainty

These codes are used for the parton shower weight uncertainty study. The signal root files are produced by following the instructions in https://github.com/kpedro88/SVJProduction for GEN-SIM production 2017. The study is performed at GEN level.

The GenMassAnalyzer.cc in SVJ/Production/plugins should be replaced by the GenMassAnalyzer.cc in this repository.

genAnalyzeBatch.py is a script that can be placed in the SVJ/Production/test folder to run GenMassAnalyzer interactively over all the signal samples of interest.
